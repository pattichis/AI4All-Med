# TERMS
1. DATA = 2-dimensional points. 
2. INPUTS = FEATURES = One-dimensional X1 and X2. Others are two-dimensional.
3. Neurons multiply their inputs and add a bias. Line thickness = weight.
4. OUTPUT = COLOR overlaid over training and testing data.

# Setup
Right-click to open [Neural Networks Playground Website in a separate window](https://playground.tensorflow.org/).
Place the windows side-by-side to continue with the instructions.

# Basic Training
1. Hit the reset button (arrow turning back left) or reload the website.
2. Note the colors of the output points. They represent different classes.
3. Look at the background color. They represent what the untrained neural network predicts the colors should be. They are NOT correct yet.
4. Click the Play button.
5. Can you see the training and testing loss graphs getting reduced?
6. Did the colors get corrected? How do you know?

# What to observe during training (after you click play):
1. Hover over each neuron (do not click on it). Look at the output.
2. Watch the train loss and test loss curves. What are the minimum values?
3. Watch the output colors evolve over time. What is the relationship to the plotted points?
4. Look  

# Train on X1 only
1. Click on any input to select or deselect it.
2. Make sure no connections are leaving any other input.
3. Train on X1 alone.
4. Why did this not work?
5. Can you think of the clinical implications of using the wrong variable in a real-world example?


# Suggested experiments for concentric dataset (upper-left)
1. Reduce the ratio of training to test data and run the play button to retrain. What happens as the ratio gets reduced? What happens when it gets increased?
2.  Wha
